## Methodology

I kept the frontend rather simple, and named it "Busy Bee" as a play on word for spelling bee...since this is a spelling checker ðŸ˜€.

The folder structure is pretty straightforward. I didn't see the need to separate everything into components across different folders or set up a router as this literally does only 1 thing.

I did add conditional statements using a functional approach though. It's a very different approach from Vue in the grand scheme of things but still relatively similar.
